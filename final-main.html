<h2 id="header1">Welcome!</h2>

<h3 id="header2">History and Description</h3>
 <p class="smallindent"><strong>Sprint races are the oldest 

recorded form of athletic competition, dating at least to the 

Olympic Games of 776 B.C. Some sources indicate that the stade 

race (approximately 200 meters) was the only event at the first 

Olympic Games. Eventually, a two-stade race was added.
Hurdles, like many track and field events, were popularized in 

British competitions in the 19th Century.</strong></p>

<p class="smallindent"><strong>The first modern Olympics (for men 

only) in 1896 included 100- and 400-meter races and a 110-meter 

hurdles event. The 200-meter dash and 400-meter hurdles were 

added in 1900, with the 4 x 100 and 4 x 400 relays entering 

competition in 1912.</strong></p>

<p class="smallindent"><strong>Women's events were added in 1928, 

including the 100-meter run and the 4 x 100 relay. Further 

additions included the 80-meter hurdles in 1932 (replaced by the 

100 hurdles in 1972), the 200 in 1948, the 400 in 1964, the 4 x 

400 relay in 1972 and the 400 hurdles in 1984.
</strong></p>

<p class="smallindent"><strong>Hurdling can be defined as the act 

of running and jumping over an obstacle at speed. In the sport of 

athletics, hurdling forms the basis of a number track and field 

events which are a highly specialized form of obstacle racing. In 

these events, a series of barriers known as hurdles are set at 

precisely measured heights and distances which each athlete must 

pass by running over. Failure to pass over, i.e. by passing 

under, or intentionally knocking over hurdles will result in 

disqualification. Accidental knocking over of hurdles is not 

cause for disqualification, as the hurdles are weighted to make 

this disadvantageous. (This is the most commonly misunderstood 

aspect of hurdling. Through my years in high school, I had many 

people ask if this was illegal, but it is not illegal, but also 

not recommended.)
</strong></p>

<h3 id="header3">Personal Bio</h3>
 <p class="smallindent"><strong>To introduce myself, I am a 

former high school hurdler who saw his career end before a 

collegiate career could blossom. Many injuries (I got pneumonia 

during my senior track season among other ailments. What 17 year 

old kid gets pneumonia?) and a decision to focus on academics led 

me away from track and hurdles, but my heart has remained with 

them. I still have a wealth of knowledge about hurdling and 

follow closely along with professional track and field. Coaching 

high school hurdles would be a great side job for me going 

forward. Putting all this together, I was thrilled to be able to 

work on a project that allowed me to learn a little more about 

hurdling and would hopefully be able to teach other people 

something about the sport I love. </strong></p>

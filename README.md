CAPP-30370-Final
================
This site is meant to inform and intrigue a viewer about the art form of hurdling. I first developed a deep passion for hurdling and track & field in 8th grade and it has not subsided. I would like to inform more people about track & field, hurdling in particular, and hopefully increase participation in this great sport.

Breakpoints occur on all 3 pages. Differences include the navigation menu which goes from all 3 lined horizontally, to 3 stacked offset vertically, then 3 stacked vertically for the mobile breakpoint.

On the info page, there are 3 columns. I wrapped all three sections in divs and limited their width to 31% at the desktop breakpoint.

Continuous loop

I made the text of the navigation menu yellow when hovered over on all 3 pages. I did this by wrapping the text of the navigation menu in individual divs and changing the div hover property to color:yellow.

My background image is on the main page.

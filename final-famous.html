 <h4 id="header13">High School</h4>

 <p class= "smallindent">Merritt's hurdling career started as a freshman in high 

school when a teammate dared him to jump a fence. Fortunately for him, his coach was 

watching and decided that Merritt should try hurdling. By his senior year of high 

school, Merritt was one of the nation's best. In his senior year he went undefeated 

in the 110m hurdles, culminating in a State Championship in Georgia with a time of 

13.76. He also finished as a runner-up in the 300m hurdles with a time of 36.71.</p>

 <h4 id="header14">College</h4>

 <p class = "smallindent">Merritt continued his success over the next 3 years at the 

University of Tennessee. The summer after his freshman year of college, he 

representeed the United States of America for the first time in the World Junior 

Championships and got his first taste of gold, winning in 13.56 seconds. For the 

Volunteers, Merritt broke many long standing records at the school, conference and 

national levels. Merritt broke the SEC meet record in his junior season, lowering it 

down to 13.29, which also set a University of Tennessee school record. Later that 

season, Merritt broke the NCAA meet record with a time of 13.21 en route to a 

National Championship. This time stands as the second fastest collegiate time ever 

ran, behind only <a href="#renaldo">Renaldo Nehemiah</a>. Merritt decided to forgo 

his senior year of collegiate eligibility to train and run professionally.</p>

 <h4 id="header15">Professional</h4>

 <p class= "smallindent">Merritt's professional career got off to a disappointing 

start with a 4th place finish at the US Olympic Trials in 2008, missing the team by 

.02 seconds. Merritt's career again appeared shaky as he finished 27th in the 2009 

World Championships, fighting injuries along the way. Merritt appeared to be stronger 

for the 2011 World Championships, finishing 5th Place with a time of 13.67 seconds. 

In the off-season before the 2012 season, Merritt readjusted his strategy and took 7 

strides before the first hurdle, instead of the typical 8. A few hurdlers had 

previously done this, such as <a href="#liu">Liu Xiang</a>, but no one had done it as 

well as Aries would do during the 2012 season.</p>

 <p class= "smallindent">Merritt's 2012 season would be one to go down in the history 

and record books. At the Olympic Trials, Merritt avenged his 4th place finish 4 years 

ago and won the Trials in a time of 12.93 seconds, the fastest time run in 2012 to 

that point and one of the fastest times ever run. In London, Merritt cruised through 

the preliminary rounds and faced the final as the favorite. Merritt delivered and 

easily claimed the Olympic title over fellow American Jason Richardson with a 

personal best time of 12.92. Merritt's dream season was not yet over. At the final 

Diamond League meet of the 2012 season about a month after the Olympics ended, 

Merritt broke through and smashed the World Record with a time of 12.80, .07 faster 

than anyone has ever run in a 110 meter race.</p>

 <p class="smallindent">Merritt's 2013 season was filled with injuries, but he was 

still able to post a 5th place finish at the World Championships in Russia. Merritt 

is continuing to train and recover and hopes to lower his own World Record.</p>

<h3 class="header13" id="liu">Liu Xiang</h3>

<h4 id="header16">High School</h4>

 <p class="smallindent">From an early age, Liu was pegged to be a gifted track 

athlete. At the age of 12, Liu was placed in a 'sports school' where he was 

encouraged to compete in the high jump, due to his height. When he was 15, the sports 

school asked him to give up the event based on a bone test that showed he would never 

grow tall enough to be a world class high jumper. Then, on a whim, he tried hurdling. 

He proved to be a natural hurdler and blossomed into a special talent. In August of 

2001, when he was 18 years old, Liu won the World University Games, competing against 

the best in the world in his age group. In 2002, Liu won the IAAF Grand Prix in 

Lausanne with an Asian record time of 13.12, breaking <a href="#renaldo">Renaldo 

Nehemiah's</a> World Junior record.</p>

<h4 id="header17">Professional</h4>

 <p class="smallindent">Liu's big break came in the 2004 Olympics in Athens. Going 

into the Games, he was considered a medal contender, but not a favorite for gold. In 

the final, at the young age of 21, he powered ahead of the competition and tied the 

World Record of 12.91 to take the Gold. In 2006 at a meet in Lausanne, where he set a 

Junior World Record, he matured and set a World Record in the 110 meter hurdles at 

12.88 seconds. The next big progression in his career came in 2008, when his home 

country was hosting the Olympics, Liu emerged as a favorite for gold in the 110 meter 

hurdles. Unfortunately, Liu developed a hamstring injury and was unable to compete in 

the Games, disappointing many in his home country. Liu did return to form in 2011, 

claiming the silver medal in the World Championships.</p>

 <p class="smallindent">If not for injuries, Liu very well may have lowered his own 

World Record in the years after he set it in 2006. Despite this, Liu is still 

considered one of the best hurdlers of all time.</p>

<h4 id="header18">High School</h4>

 <p class="smallindent">Nehemiah's first tried hurdles becasue "everyone else was 

afraid of 'em". He then went on to become the most talented hurdler of all time. In 

high school, he won races by such a wide margin, that his coach raised Nehemiah's 

hurdles up to Olympic height to try to make races closer. His senior year, Nehemiah 

ran 12.9 in the 110 meter hurdles and 35.8 in the 300 meter hurdles. Since these were 

hand timed, they could not count for official national records, although they both 

would have broken their respective records by wide margins. The current High School 

National record is 13.30, a significant amount slower than Nehemiah ran. When he 

graduated high school, Nehemiah was only 5'9", much shorter than the other hurdlers 

he was running against. He grew to only be 6 feet tall, defying the prototypical 

hurdler frame. Nehemiah has gone down in history as one of, if not the greatest prep 

hurdler of all time.</p>

<h4 id="header19">College</h4>

 <p class="smallindent">Nehemiah went on to compete for the University of Maryland. 

Nehemiah felt slighted by his preferred college of choice, the University of 

Tennessee, who did not offer him a full scholarship, supposedly because they thought 

he had already reached his peak after such an outstanding prep career. Some of 

Nehemiah's best performances at Maryland came during ihs sophomore year. At the 

famous Penn Relays, Nehemiah led his team to 4 Championships, anchoring his team in 

the 4x400 meter relay, 4x200 meter relay, the shuttle hurdle relay, and of course, 

the 110 meter hurdles. Showing off his versatility, Nehemiah was able to lead his 

team in all of these relays. Also during his sophomore year of college at the age of 

20, Nehemiah broke the world record twice. First he broke it with a time of 13.16 

early in the season, then shattering his record the following week with a time of 

13.00. Although Nehemiah continued to study at the University of Maryland after  his 

sophomore year, he decided give up his scholarship and compete professionally, 

accepting a sponsorship by Puma.</p>

<h4 id="header20">Professional</h4>

<p class="smallindent">With his declaration to run professionally and running at the 

peak of his career, Nehemiah was set to represent the US in the 1980 Olympics and 

bring home a gold medal for his country. But due to the boycott the 1980 Games in 

Moscow, Nehemiah was not able to compete in the Olympics that he so desired. This 

decision irked Nehemiah and it would lead to a later career switch for Nehemiah. In 

1981, Nehemiah broke his own world record, being the first man to run under 13 

seconds with a time of 12.93 seconds, a time which Nehemiah said he could have 

lowered significantly with a perfect race. Until <a href="#aries">Aries Merritt</a> 

broke the World Record in 2012, it had only been lowered .06 seconds to 12.87 in 31 

years. Not to mention, hurdlers and athletes in today's era have many more advantages 

in terms of technology and training regiments.</p> 

 <p class="smallindent">Then, when he was on top of the hurdling world, Nehemiah 

abruptly decided to play professional football, playing for the San Francisco 49ers. 

Despite never playing football in college, Nehemiah played for 3 years, amassing 43 

catches for 754 yards and 4 touchdowns. He was a part of the 1984 Super Bowl Champion 

49ers, but played a minor role. Though this career appears strong, it paled in 

comparison to what he accomplished and could have accomplished if he had stayed with 

track. As to why he left track, Nehemiah says, "[The boycott of the 1980 Olympics] is 

the reason why I switched to professional football. I didn't want to risk another 

four years of training for nothing." According to Nehemiah, if he hadn't quit track, 

he would have run a time in the 12.8 range. Nehemiah says, "I ran 12.86, 12.82, but 

they didn't give me credit for it becasue they didn't think anybody could run that 

fast. They said that the timing system malfunctioned, so they didn't count it." 

Nehemiah returned to track after his football career ended, but was never able to 

return to his top form, running his fastest time in the second half of his career in 

1991, running a 13.19. Nehemiah qualified for the World Championships, but did not 

compete due to an injury.</p>

 <p class="smallindent">Despite his foray into professional football, Nehemiah is 

still considered one of, if not the greatest hurdler of all time. His grace and 

fluidity over the hurdles has not been replicated by another hurdler yet. Nehemiah 

brought the concept of "hurdling as an art form" to the sport, instilling the notion 

of technique over power and speed.</p>

 <p class="smallindent">Not actually a hurdler. Saw this on Google Images and thought 

it was too good to pass up on. It has messed up my spacing a bit and I don't really 

know how to go about fixing that (without adding a bunch of filler text that would 

take up space and hopefully resolve the issue), but once again, this picture is worth 

it.</p>

<h3 class="header16" id="moses">Edwin Moses</h3>
 <p class= "indent"><em>400 Meter Hurdles</em></p>
 <p class= "indent"><em>Former World Record Holder & 2 Time Olympic Champion</em></p>
 <img id="mosespic" src="http://blog.weloveglasses.com/wp-

content/uploads/001aa018ff9c0812da115e.jpeg" alt="Edwin Moses">

<h4 id="header21">High School</h4>
 <p class= "smallindent">Moses always took academics more seriously than most kids 

his age, based on his parents backgrounds as educators. Moses started in track after 

being cut from his high school basketball team and kicked out of his football team 

for fighting. This switch better suited Moses. According to him, "I found that I 

enjoyed individual sports much more. Everything is cut and dry; nothing is arbitrary. 

It's just a matter of getting to the finish line first. Any individual sport is 

basically a gladiator sport. Back in the old days only one guy would walk out of the 

arena. In track, it's basically the same thing."</p>

<h4 id="header22">College</h4>
 <p class= "smallindent">Rather than seeking an athletic scholarship after a solid 

high school career, Moses accepted an academic scholarship to Morehouse College in 

Atlanta, majoring in physics and engineering. Though the school had a track team, it 

did not have a track of its own. Moses trained at public high school facilities 

around Atlanta in order to prepare for his meets. Mostly, Moses competed in the 110 

meter hurdles, the 400 meters and the 4x100 meter relay. Just once before late March 

1976 did he ever compete in a 400 hurdle race. But very soon thereafter, Moses would 

revolutionize the race forever.</p>

 <p class= "smallindent">Due to his knowledge of physics and kinesiology, Moses was 

able to plan out his strides throughout the course of his race and he found that he 

could take 13 strides between hurdles all the way around the track. Some hurdlers had 

attempted this, but none were able to run 13 strides in between every hurdle for the 

full 400 meter hurdles because they did not have the endurance to do so. Because of 

Moses strength and long stride length, fewer strides meant less time between each 

hurdle. Moses trademark race became staying even with the pack for the first 200 

meters, then blowing away the field in the second 200 meters because of Moses' 

intense training regiment and his 13 stride technique. Since Moses developed this in 

1976, every world-class 400 meter hurdler has at least attempted to run 13 strides 

between every hurdle.</p>

<p class= "smallindent">Despite training on high school tracks, Moses was able to 

qualify for the Olympic Trials at the age of 20. At the US Olympic Trials, Moses won 

and set an American record of 48.30. In his first international competition, Moses 

blew away the field and won in a world record time of 47.63. He won the race by 8 

meters, the largest margin of victory in the race in Olympic history.</p>

<h4 id="header23">Professional</h4>
 <p class= "smallindent">On August 26, 1977, after previously re-setting his world 

record, Moses lost to West Germany's Harald Schmid in Berlin. This would be the last 

time Moses lost a race until June 4, 1987, a period of 9 years, 9 months and 9 days. 

This totaled 122 consecutive races, a number that has not been challenged by any 

competitor in any track event. It currently stands in the Guinness Book of World 

Records to this date as the most consecutive victories by an individual athlete. This 

streak spanned over 2 Olympic Gold Medals and including 2 more world records, 

lowering his world record down to 47.02. Similar to <a href="#renaldo">Renaldo 

Nehemiah</a>, Moses was unable to compete in the 1980 Olympics because of the US 

boycott. Moses, known for being exceptionally calm in large, world-class meets, would 

have assuredly won his 3rd Gold Medal in Moscow had he been able to compete. Moses' 

track career came to an end shortly after winning a bronze medal in the 1988 Olympics 

in Seoul.</p>  

 <p class= "smallindent">After retiring from track and field, Moses kept his 

international competitive spirit alive, competing in the two-man bobsled. He and his 

teammate won the bronze medal at the 1990 World Cup and 7th at the 1991 World 

Championships. Since then, Moses has received a Master's from Pepperdine University, 

was elected into the USATF Hall of Fame and has been president of the International 

Amateur Athletic Association. More recently, Moses won the Congressional Medal of 

Honor, the highest civilian award given to American citizens. Moses legacy remains in 

his revolution of the 400 meter hurdle race and his laid back, calm demeanor at big 

meets, epitmoized by his large, dark sunglasses and his large necklaces he would wear 

during races. He still holds 4 of the top 8 times ever run in the 400 meter 

hurdles.</p>

alt="Felix Sanchez">

<h4 id="header24">High School/College</h4>
 <p class= "smallindent">Sanchez was born in New York City to Dominican-born parents 

and was raised in San Diego, California. He attended University City High School and 

San Diego Mesa College in the city, and then went on to study psychology at the 

University of Southern California in 1998. Competing for University of Southern 

California's USC Trojans, he was a Pac-10 champion in the 400 meter hurdles and All-

American relay champion in the 4x400 meter relay in 1999.</p>

<h4 id="header25">Professional</h4>
 <p class="smallindent">Sanchez opted to represent the Dominican Republic 

internationally, despite being born and raised in the United Staes. In his first 

Olympics in 2000, Sanchez faltered and did not make the finals. For the next 4 years 

leading up to Athens, he wore a red wristband that was given to him to the athletes 

at Sydney as part of their gift package to remind him every time he stepped on the 

track of the defeat he faced in Sydney. From 2001 to 2004, Sanchez won 43 races in a 

row, including 2 World Championships. At the 2003 World Championships, he ran his 

personal best time of 47.25, best for 8th all time. Then later in 2004, Sanchez 

triumphed over his defeat in 2000 and won the Olympic Games. After the race, Sanchez 

donated the red wristband to the IAAF (International Association of Athletics 

Federations) and they auctioned it off and gave the profits to charity.</p>

<p class="smallindent">With hopes of repeating as Olympic Champion, Sanchez came to 

Beijing to win his second Olympic title. But on the day of his preliminary race, he 

learned that his grandmother Lillian had died. He was heartbroken over this news 

since he was so close to her. He was unable to make the final and all hope was 

seemingly lost for a second Olympic Gold Medal. Many told Sanchez to retire in the 

years leading up to the London Olympics after many injuries and old age (34 in 2012), 

but Sanchez had the goal and dream of winning his second Gold. In the heats and final 

of the 2012 Olympics, Sanchez ran with a picture of his grandmother Lillian under his 

racing bib for inspiration. In the finals, the 34 year old hurdler won his second 

Gold Medal in the same time he ran in 2004, 47.63 seconds. He is the oldest person to 

win the 400 meter hurdles in Olympic history. Sanchez's story of perserverance is an 

aspiring for hurdlers and non-athletes alike.</p>

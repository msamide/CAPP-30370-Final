<h2>General Hurdling Technique</h2>

<p>In order to obtain the optimal hurdling technique, one must first learn 

the proper running techniques. It's important that the runner stays on the 

balls of his or her feet for the entirety of the race. This makes a fluid 

movement between each stage of the race.</p>

<p>There is a technique that is desirable to accomplish efficient hurdling 

action during a race. Many runners rely mainly on raw speed, but proper 

technique and well-planned steps leading up to and between each hurdle can 

allow an efficient hurdler to outrun faster opponents. Generally, the 

efficient hurdler spends the minimum amount of time and energy going 

vertically over the hurdle, thus achieving maximum speed in the horizontal 

race direction down the track.</p>

<p>When approaching the first hurdle, athletes try to avoid stutter stepping 

(a term used to refer to the cutting of stride length before reaching a 

hurdle). This cuts the runner's momentum and costs valuable time. Athletes 

attack the hurdle by launching at it from 6-7 feet away (depending on 

runner's closing speed). the lead leg extended yet slightly bent (because a 

straight leg leads to more time over the hurdle) so that the heel just 

narrowly clears the barrier's height. After launching, the trail leg is 

tucked in horizontally and flat, close to the side of the hip. The objective 

is to minimize center-of-gravity deviation from normal sprinting and reduce 

time spent flying through the air.</p>

<p>In order to hurdle properly and not simply jump over it, a runner must 

adjust his or her hips to raise them over the hurdles. This involves the 

correct use of the lead leg, trail leg, and arm positions. The lead leg is 

the leg that goes over the hurdle first, and should remain fairly straight. 

Upon crossing over the hurdle barrier, the runner's lead leg snaps down 

quickly landing roughly 3 feet (1m) beyond the hurdle. The trail leg follows 

the lead leg. The trail leg drives forward at the knee (not swinging, as 

swinging causes the trunk to straighten up), and pulls through to maintain 

stride length. An effective trail leg will be parallel to the top of the 

hurdle and will be as close to the top of the hurdle as possible. The arm 

position is the most critical aspects that people often ignore. As the lead 

leg is being lifted over the hurdle, the opposite arm should cross the body 

parallel to the ground. This helps with the runner's balance and rhythm 

throughout the race.</p>

<p>In men's hurdles it is usually necessary to straighten the leg at the top 

of the flight path over the hurdle, although a partial bend in the knee gains 

a faster push off when the athlete hits the ground. The ability to do this 

depends on the runners's leg length. As soon as the foot has cleared the 

hurdle, the knee starts bending again to lessen the effect of a long, slow 

pendulum. In women's hurdles, the lead leg is usually straight and the center 

of gravity does not rise relative to a normal running stride. Another way to 

view it is the foot path: "shortest path up and shortest path down". The 

opposite arm reaches farther forward and the elbow travels out to the side 

and then behind to make room for the trailing leg. The trailing leg also 

leads with the knee, but the foot and knee is horizontal, tucked up as tight 

as possible into the armpit.</p>

<p>As soon as the lead leg begins its descent, a strong downward push is 

exerted to enable the trailing leg's knee to come up under the armpit and in 

front of the chest. This enables recovery of some of the energy expended in 

the flight. As the lead leg touches down to the ground, it's critical that 

the runner remains in a sprint. As soon as his or her lead leg touches down, 

the trail leg arm drives the rest of the body forward.</p>

<p>In the 100 and 110 meter hurdle events, the fastest hurdlers use the 

three-step technique. This means that three large steps are taken in between 

all of the hurdles. In order to do this efficiently, hurdlers must take long 

strides and maintain their speed for the entire race. If a hurdler begins to 

slow down while three-stepping, they may not be able to make it through all 

of the hurdles and may have to switch to four-stepping or five-stepping 

technique. When three-stepping, a hurdler will use the same lead leg for all 

of the hurdles. If a hurdler four-steps, they will have to switch lead legs 

at each hurdle.</p>

<p>A modern hurdle will fall over if a runner hits it. There is no penalty 

for hitting a hurdle (provided this is not judged deliberate). The 

misconception is based on old rules before the hurdles were weighted. In the 

1932 Olympics, Bob Tisdall famously won the Olympic Gold medal in the 400 

metre hurdles in World Record time, but was not credited with the record due 

to knocking over a hurdle. There can be disqualification if a hurdler knocks 

a hurdle into an opponents lane and it is judged to have interfered with the 

opponent's ability to run the race. There are now specifications for the 

tipping weight of a hurdle (the weights need to be adjusted to correspond 

with the height of the hurdle) so hitting a hurdle theoretically slows down 

the rhythm of the hurdler. However, pushing the hurdle with one's hands or 

running out of one's lane as a result of hitting the hurdle is cause for 

disqualification. While hitting hurdles is not generally considered 

desirable, a few sprint hurdlers have succeeded despite knocking over many 

hurdles. Contact with hurdles can decrease speed and also result in 

disruption of a hurdler's technique. Some coaches suggest if you lightly 

"kiss" the hurdle with the side of the leg closest to the hurdle, it can help 

with the runners speed by keeping the runner closer to the ground.</p>

<h2>110 Meter Hurdle Specific Technique</h2>

<p>The sprint hurdles are a very rhythmic race because both men and women 

take 3 steps (meaning 4 foot strikes) between each hurdle, no matter whether 

running 110/100 meters outdoors, or the shorter distances indoors (55 or 60 

meters). In addition, the distance from the starting line to the first hurdle 

- while shorter for women - is constant for both sexes whether indoors or 

outdoors, so sprint hurdlers do not need to change their stride pattern 

between indoor and outdoor seasons. One difference between indoor and 

outdoors is the shorter finishing distance from the last (5th) hurdle 

indoors, compared to longer distance from the last (10th) hurdle outdoors to 

the finish line.</p>

<p>Top male hurdlers traditionally took 8 strides from the starting blocks to 

the first hurdle (indoors and outdoors). The 8-step start persisted from (at 

least) the 1950s to the end of the 20th century and included such World- and 

Olympic champions as Harrison Dillard, Rod Milburn, Greg Foster, <a 

href="http://www3.nd.edu/~msamide/final-famous.html#renaldo">Renaldo 

Nehemiah</a>, Roger Kingdom, Allen Johnson, Mark Crear, Mark McCoy, and Colin 

Jackson. However, beginning in the 2000s, some hurdle coaches embraced a 

transition to a faster 7-step start, teaching the men to lengthen their first 

few strides out of the starting blocks. Cuban hurdler Dayron Robles set his 

2008 world record of 12.87 using a 7-step start. Chinese star <a 

href="http://www3.nd.edu/~msamide/final-famous.html#liu">Liu Xiang</a> won 

the 2004 Olympics and broke the world record in 2006 utilizing an 8-step 

approach, but he switched to 7-steps by the 2011 outdoor season. After the 

2010 outdoor season, American Jason Richardson trained to switch to a 7-step 

start and went on to win the 2011 World Championship. American Aries Merritt 

trained in Fall 2011 to switch from 8 to 7, and then had his greatest outdoor 

season in 2012 - running 8 races in under 13 seconds - capped by winning the 

London 2012 Olympics and then setting a world record of 12.80.</p>

<p>Of the 10 men with the fastest 110m hurdle times in 2012, seven used 7-

steps, including the top 4: <a href="http://www3.nd.edu/~msamide/final-

famous.html#aries">Aries Merritt</a>, <a 

href="http://www3.nd.edu/~msamide/final-famous.html#liu">Liu Xiang</a>, Jason 

Richardson, and David Oliver. Hurdle technique experts believe the off-season 

training required to produce the power and speed necessary to reach the first 

hurdle in 7 steps, yields greater endurance over the last half of the race. 

That added endurance allows hurdlers to maintain their top speed to the 

finish, resulting in a faster time.</p>

<div class="third">
<h2>400 Meter Hurdle Specific Technique</h2>

<p>"The 400m hurdle race one of the most demanding of all events in the 

sprint-hurdle group." (Lindeman) It requires speed, endurance, and hurdling 

technique all along with unique awareness and special concentration 

throughout the race.</p>

<h3>Block Start</h3>

<p>When preparing to hurdle, the blocks should be set so that the athlete 

arrives at the first hurdle leading on the desired leg without inserting a 

stutter step. A stutter step is when the runner has to chop his or her stride 

down to arrive on the "correct" leg for take off. Throughout the race, any 

adjustments to stride length stride speed should be made several strides out 

from the hurdle because a stutter or being too far from the hurdle at take 

off will result in loss of momentum and speed.</p>

<h3>Going over the hurdle</h3>

<p>At the beginning of the take-off, the knee must be driven toward the 

hurdle and the foot then extended. The knee should be slightly bent when 

crossing the hurdle. Unless an athlete's body has great flexibility, the knee 

must be slightly bent to allow a forward body lean. Unlike the 110m hurdles, 

a significant forward body learn is not that necessary due to the hurdles 

being lower. However, the trail leg must be kept bent and short to provide a 

quick lever action allowing a fast hurdle clearance. The knee should pull 

through under the armpit and should not be flat across the top of the hurdle.
It is also important that the hurdler doesn't reach out on the last stride 

before the hurdle as this will result in a longer bound being made to clear 

the hurdle. This will also result in a loss of momentum if the foot lands 

well in front of the center of gravity.</p>

<h3>Stride Length</h3>

<p>Using a left lead leg on the bends allows the hurdler to run closer to the 

inside of the lane and cover a shorter distance. Additionally, if the left 

leg is used for the lead, then the athlete's upper body can be leaned to the 

left, making it easier to bring the trail leg through. Additionally, an 

athlete hurdling with a right leg lead around the bends must take care that 

they do not inadvertently trail their foot or toe around the hurdle rather 

than passing over the top, which would lead to a disqualifciation from the 

race. At an early age, many coaches train their athletes to hurdle with both 

legs. This is a useful skill to learn since as a runner tires, their stride 

length may decrease, resulting in the need either to add a stutter stride, or 

to take a hurdle on the other leg. The 400 metre hurdles is a very physically 

demanding race. It requires intense training to get the endurance, speed and 

technique needed to compete.</p>
